Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
- Schedule a kickoff meeting with the supervisor to outline goals and objectives.
- Set up GitHub repository and clone the master template.
- Begin a deep dive into existing research about LLMs and their use in search result evaluation.
* **Week 2**
- Continue Research
- Design Experiments: Based on at least one of the questions raised from "One-Shot Labeling for Automatic Relevance Estimation":
1. Design an experiment to test the efficacy of LLMs on long documents.
2. Outline methods to handle scenarios with multiple known relevant documents.
3. Propose strategies for utilizing known non-relevant documents as signals.
* **Week 3**
- Explore and analyze datasets from the "One-Shot Labeling for Automatic Relevance Estimation" repository.
- Examine datasets for usability and applicability in the project.
- Troubleshoot technical issues related to Google Collab and understand its environment.
- Start hands-on experimentation to enhance practical understanding.
* **Week 4**
- Focus on overcoming the "hard steps" including dealing with the runtime environment, data importation, and preparation issues in Google Collab.
- Resolve issues related to running scripts and possible timeout/interrupt issues in Google Collab.
- Begin experiments on replicating existing experiments with long documents, using documents in the 90th percentile of the existing datasets.
- Engage in continuous correspondence with the supervisor regarding the challenges faced and gain insights on the next steps.
